Case Challenge: 
Analyze NBA fans and their twitter engagement and support Nikeâ€™s marketing team in understanding the market. 
We were given datasets of months of Jan 2019 - Oct 2020 to explore.

I used the November 2019 dataset because of a few reasons:
Black Friday 
Cyber Monday
Basketball league happening
Pre-Christmas shopping

= MORE INSIGHTS
